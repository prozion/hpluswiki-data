The \"wellness revolution,\" especially in terms of diet and exercise, has been affected by both scientific findings and cultural changes. The paper examines how a particular aspect of culture, the moral meanings of health-promoting activities, contribute to the pursuit of wellness. Based on interviews with 54 self-identified wellness participants at a major university, we examine how health can be a moral discourse and the body a site for moral action. The paper suggests that wellness seekers engage in a profoundly moral discourse around health promotion, constructing a moral world of goods, bads and shoulds. Although there are some gender differences in particular wellness goals, engaging in wellness activities, independent of results, becomes seen as a good in itself. Thus, even apart from any health outcomes, the pursuit of virtue and a moral life is fundamentally an aspect of the pursuit of wellness.") ((u . "JID") u . "7707467") ((u . "MHDA") u .

"OBJECTIVE: To compare the temperature and humidification output of one heated humidifier system (Bennett Cascade 2 Humidifier) and two heat and moisture exchangers (Pall Ultipor, BB 50, and Humid-Vent Filter) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients submitted to a minute ventilation of > 10 L/min. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomized, unblinded study. SETTING: ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eleven sedated and paralyzed patients who required controlled mechanical ventilation with a minute ventilation of > 10 L/min for > 3 days. INTERVENTIONS: After a randomized selection process, the patients were ventilated for 24-hr periods with the humidifier and one of the heat and moisture exchangers. Both heat and moisture exchangers were first tested for 45 mins; then, the heat and moisture exchanger that demonstrated the best performance in terms of temperature and water preservation was tested for 24 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the inspiration phase for each patient, the following measurements were performed: mean and minimum values of temperature, relative and absolute humidity of inspired gases. During the 45-min test period, the Humid-Vent Filter had a better temperature and humidification output than the Pall Ultipor Filter and thus was tested for 24 hrs. The Bennett Cascade 2 Humidifier and the Humid-Vent Filter had a better thermic capacity than the Pall Ultipor Filter (p < .001). No difference was ever observed between the Bennett Cascade 2 Humidifier and the Humid-Vent Filter regarding relative humidity. The Pall Ultipor Filter had a lower temperature and humidification output when compared with the other two systems (p < .007). Concerning absolute humidity of inspired gases, the Pall Ultipor Filter achieved a lower performance than any other tested systems (p < .02). A small but significant decrease in temperature and absolute humidity, but not in relative humidity, was seen after 24 hrs of use with the Humid-Vent Filter. However, with this heat and moisture exchanger, all patients had an absolute humidity of > 28 mg H2O/L and a relative humidity of > 93% after 24 hrs of use. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a minute ventilation of > 10 L/min (> 10.5 to 16.0 L/min), the Humid-Vent Filter had a temperature and humidification output close to the reference system (the Bennett Cascade 2 Humidifier). The Pall Ultipor Filter had a significantly lower temperature and humidification output in these patients.") ((u . "JID") u . "0355501") ((u . "MHDA") u . "1994/11/01 00:01") ((u . "AD") u .

The synthesis of a population of small macromolecules decreased in the cultured controls, but was maintained at a constant level in the experimental samples. This population was isolated through Sepharose CL-2B chromatography. Subsequent application to Sepharose CL-4B yielded two distinct peaks. One contained protein-free chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and possibly some dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. The other, more prominent, peak consisted of dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. This peak material was pooled, and applied to a 4-15% SDS-gel. The material was separated into two major bands, which represented biglycan and decorin. They decreased to less than half their day-0 value, in the cultured control. In the loaded cartilage, biglycan synthesis remained constant while decorin synthesis increased.

The interview schedule was designed on problem-solving lines to establish whether children could identify and respond safely to a wide range of potentially unsafe situations. One year later, 117 of the children were available for interview using the same questionnaire. Children exposed to Keeping Ourselves Safe had retained and increased their safety strategies during that time. The variables of gender, age, race, and academic level did not affect improvement but the number of initial gains by children with highly committed teachers was almost double the number achieved by teachers classified as having low levels of commitment.

Measurements were made when infants received no CPAP and repeated when 5 and 8 cm H2O CPAP were applied to the airway opening via a modified Mapleson anesthesia circuit. Expiratory resistance (RL), midexpiratory tidal flow (VE50), and maximal flow at functional residual capacity (Vmax FRC) were compared at each level of CPAP. Vmax FRC increased threefold from baseline to 8 cm H2O CPAP (p < 0.005). In contrast, there was no difference in expiratory RL or in VE50 at any level of CPAP.

Mesenteric membranes were spread over the hole of a cytocentrifuge paper, incubated in vitro, and exposed to various concentrations of TGF-beta with or without serum added. At designated times after incubation, the specimens were fixed, spread out on microscope slides, and stained by the Feulgen reaction. Cell proliferation was estimated by counting mitoses in fibroblasts and mesothelial cells and by DNA cytometry of fibroblast nuclei using computer assisted image analyses. Higher concentrations of TGF-beta significantly increased proliferation estimated as either the percentage of cells in the S+G2 phase of the cell cycle or the mitotic index when serum was added. In medium without serum, TGF-beta did slightly, but not significantly, increase proliferation. The results show that TGF-beta stimulates connective tissue cell proliferation dose-dependently in intact connective tissue in vitro and that addition of serum to the medium is a prerequisite for optimal stimulation.")

"Cyclic AMP binding proteins have been measured in normal breast tissue, in a variety of physiological conditions including resting state (69 cases), pregnancy (15 cases), lactation (4 cases), post-lactational involution (6 cases), and prolonged involution (10 cases). Levels varied greatly within the groups but median values were elevated in pregnancy, lactation, and post-lactational involution as compared with the resting and prolonged involutionary states. The proportion of different types of cyclic AMP binding proteins also differed between groups. Resting breast showed approximately equal amounts of type I and II whereas pregnant and postlactational involuting breast tissue had an increased proportion of type I binding, and the prolonged involutionary state tended to be associated with low type I. Within the subgroup of nulliparous resting breasts, the proportion of type I cyclic AMP binding protein was significantly elevated during the second half of the menstrual cycle compared with the first (p < 0.05). There were also significant positive associations between the level of epithelial proliferation and both total (p < 0.015) and type I (p < 0.002) cyclic AMP binding. This represents the strongest of association thus far reported between signalling systems and proliferation in the normal breast.") ((u . "JID") u . "8111104") ((u . "MHDA") u .
